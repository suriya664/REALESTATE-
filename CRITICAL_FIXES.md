### 2. **Left Alignment Issues** ‚úì
**Problem:** Content appeared left-aligned, not centered  
**Fix:** Added proper column grid system and text-center utilities

**Files Modified:**
- `layout.css`: Added col-lg-x and col-md-x responsive grid classes
- Grid system now properly responsive across all breakpoints

**What Was Added:**
```css
/* Large Desktop - 1200px and up */
@media (min-width: 1200px) {
    .col-lg-1 through .col-lg-12
}

/* Desktop - 992px to 1199px */
@media (min-width: 992px) and (max-width: 1199px) {
    .col-md-1 through .col-md-12
}
```

### 3. **Overlapping Sections & Cards** ‚úì
**Problem:** Sections and cards were overlapping each other  
**Fix:** Added proper spacing, margins, and clear properties

**Files Modified:**
- `style.css`: Added clear:both, overflow:hidden, and proper section padding
- Cards now have margin-bottom: 30px for consistent spacing
- Sections have clear float properties to prevent overlap

**Key Changes:**
```css
section {
    padding: var(--section-padding) 0;
    clear: both;
    position: relative;
    overflow: hidden;
}

.card {
    margin-bottom: 30px; /* Prevents cards from overlapping */
}
```

### 4. **Responsive Grid System** ‚úì
**Problem:** Grid classes (col-lg-x, col-md-x) were missing from layout.css  
**Fix:** Added complete responsive grid system with proper breakpoints

**Files Modified:**
- `layout.css`: Added large and medium breakpoint grid classes
- `responsive.css`: Corrected media query breakpoints from max-width to proper ranges

**Responsive Breakpoints:**
- **Large (lg):** min-width: 1200px ‚Üí Desktop & up
- **Medium (md):** min-width: 992px ‚Üí Tablet & desktop

- **Extra Small (xs):** max-width: 576px ‚Üí Mobile portrait

### 5. **Section Spacing** ‚úì
**Problem:** Sections didn't have proper vertical spacing  
**Fix:** Added responsive section padding that scales with screen size

**Added:**
```css
section {
    padding: 80px 0; /* Desktop */
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
    section {
        padding: 40px 0; /* Mobile */
    }
}

@media (max-width: 576px) {
    section {
        padding: 30px 0; /* Small mobile */
    }
